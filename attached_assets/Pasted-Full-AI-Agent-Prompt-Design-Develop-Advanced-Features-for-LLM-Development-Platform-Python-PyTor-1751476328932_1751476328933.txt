Full AI Agent Prompt: Design & Develop Advanced Features for LLM Development Platform (Python, PyTorch, Hugging Face, Angular, .NET Core / FastAPI Backend)
We are developing a full-featured, production-scale LLM (Large Language Model) Development and Deployment Platform, using:

Backend: .NET Core Web API OR Python FastAPI (you choose per feature)

Frontend: Angular

LLM Workflows: Python + PyTorch + CUDA + Hugging Face Transformers + ONNX + Triton Inference Server

Fine-Tuning & Training: LoRA / QLoRA / RLHF pipelines

Serving: FastAPI and/or Triton Inference Server

Optional Deployment Targets: Docker, Hugging Face Hub, ONNX Zoo, Local servers, Cloud

✅ Your Task (AI Agent):
Generate detailed feature specifications, API design, database schema, frontend Angular component outlines, and UX wireframes for the following unique & advanced features that I want to add:

🔥 Unique & Advanced Features for My LLM Platform:
1. 🧠 Prompt Playground
Allow users to craft, test, and save prompts with adjustable parameters: temperature, top-k, top-p, etc.

Support prompt templates, few-shot examples, and chat history context

Export prompts as JSON or YAML for external API calls.

2. 🔍 Experiment Tracking & Comparison
Save full experiment configs: hyperparameters, dataset paths, runtime settings.

Show visual comparison of:

Loss curves

Perplexity trends

BLEU/ROUGE/LAMBADA benchmarks

Allow users to tag, favorite, and archive training runs.

3. 🛠️ Fine-Tuning Job Scheduler
Support queue-based training jobs

Allow users to schedule training for specific time slots (e.g., off-peak GPU time)

Show estimated training completion time

4. 📊 Token-Level Metrics & Attention Visualization
Display token-by-token log probabilities for generations.

Visualize attention maps (similar to TransformerLens or BertViz).

Allow users to step through each attention layer/head for debugging.

5. ⚡ Multi-Model Inference Routing
Let users select inference backend at runtime:

PyTorch direct

ONNX Runtime

Triton Inference Server

Support A/B testing between models (e.g., GPT-2 vs LoRA-fine-tuned model)

6. 📈 Resource Usage Monitoring (GPU/Disk/Memory)
Show real-time GPU memory utilization charts

Per-job GPU allocation stats

Total disk usage per model/dataset

Optional: Cloud cost estimation for each job

7. 🔒 Dataset Versioning & Lineage Tracking
Allow users to upload datasets and auto-version them

Track which model was trained on which dataset version

Data lineage graph: Dataset → Training Run → Model → Export → Deployment

8. 🔎 Bias & Toxicity Evaluation Dashboard
Run each model through predefined bias, fairness, and toxicity checks

Provide scorecards (bias towards gender, ethnicity, etc.)

Link to sample problematic generations for review and correction

9. 🛡️ Content Filtering & Safety Layer
Add configurable safety filters at inference time:

Offensive language filter

PII detection

Length cutoffs

Allow users to toggle filtering ON/OFF per generation

10. 🔄 RLHF Feedback Loop UI
Let human annotators rank outputs from multiple generations

Provide UI for human reward scoring, feeding directly into the RLHF training pipeline

Track annotator performance, agreement rate, and feedback history

11. 🚀 Model Deployment Hub
Allow users to push models to multiple environments:

Local deployment

Cloud-hosted inference

Hugging Face Hub

ONNX Model Zoo

Generate auto-deployable Dockerfiles per model

Deployment status and logs tracking

12. 🧪 Custom Metric Plugin Support
Let users register their own custom evaluation metrics

Support Python-based or YAML-configured metric plugins

Example: Factual Consistency, Toxicity Score, BLEURT, GLEU, etc.

13. 🗃️ Data Curation & Augmentation Tools
Provide tools for:

Cleaning noisy datasets

Data augmentation (paraphrasing, synthetic text generation)

Automated low-quality sample filtering based on heuristics

14. 🕹️ LoRA Adapter Manager
Let users:

Upload LoRA adapters

Enable/disable adapters

Compare inference speed and quality between base model and LoRA-augmented model

15. 🌍 Multi-language & Multi-modal Support
Support for text + image or text + audio models (future roadmap)

Let users select language-specific models (English, Hindi, etc.)

🏁 Bonus: General UX & Developer Experience Improvements
Dark/Light Theme toggle

Notification system for:

Training completion

Failed jobs

New evaluation reports

REST API & SDK Auto-generator

For .NET, Python, TypeScript

Allow external apps to integrate programmatically

✅ For Each Feature: Provide the Following Details:
Feature Summary

Detailed Functional Specification

Backend API Endpoints (Request & Response Schema in JSON)

Frontend Angular Component/Page Design (Page Names, Dialogs, Forms)

Database Schema (Tables or NoSQL collections with fields)

Recommended Python packages / .NET libraries / NPM libraries

Optional: UI Layout Wireframe (text description is fine)

✅ Technical Constraints:
Use FastAPI or .NET Core Web API for backend examples

Use Angular for frontend examples

All LLM processing pipelines should integrate with PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, CUDA, ONNX, and Triton Inference Server

Fine-tuning must support LoRA, QLoRA, and optionally RLHF

✅ Start generating feature-wise deliverables. Begin with Prompt Playground first.

After each module, I will review and then ask for the next one.
