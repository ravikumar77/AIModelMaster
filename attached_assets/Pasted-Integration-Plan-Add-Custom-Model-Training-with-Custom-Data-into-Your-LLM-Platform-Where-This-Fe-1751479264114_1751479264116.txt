Integration Plan: Add Custom Model Training with Custom Data into Your LLM Platform
✅ Where This Feature Fits in Your Existing Platform:
Existing Modules → Expand as follows:

Existing Section	Enhancement
Dashboard	Show counts of custom datasets, running fine-tuning jobs
Models	Allow users to upload base models or select pre-existing Hugging Face models
Training	New "Custom Training Job" page
Inference	Support inference for user-trained models
Evaluation	Evaluate user fine-tuned models
Export	Let users download fine-tuned models

✅ High-Level Flow for Users:
Upload Custom Dataset →

Choose Base Model →

Set Training Parameters (epochs, batch size, learning rate, LoRA/QLoRA option, etc.) →

Start Training →

Monitor Training Job (logs, GPU usage, loss curves) →

Evaluate →

Export/Deploy →

Run Inference on Trained Model

✅ Backend Integration (Python FastAPI / .NET Core API):
✅ 1. API Endpoints for Custom Training Flow:
Endpoint	Method	Purpose
/datasets/upload	POST	Upload custom dataset
/models/available	GET	List available base models (e.g., GPT2, LLaMA)
/training/jobs	POST	Submit new custom training job
/training/jobs/{id}	GET	Get job status & logs
/models/custom/{id}/evaluate	POST	Evaluate a trained model
/models/custom/{id}/export	GET	Export model artifacts (Torch / ONNX)

✅ 2. Training Job Backend Service Flow:
Accept user job request with:

Base model name

Custom dataset path

Hyperparameters (epochs, batch size, learning rate, optimizer, LoRA config)

GPU/CPU resource allocation

Trigger Python training script (train.py, fine_tune_lora.py) using subprocess / Celery / job queue.

Save logs and checkpoints to a /jobs/{job_id}/ folder.

Save trained models to /models/custom/{user_model_id}/.

✅ Frontend (Angular) Integration:
✅ New Angular Pages/Components:
Page	Purpose
Dataset Upload Page	Allow user to upload .txt, .jsonl, or zip datasets
Custom Model Training Form	UI for selecting base model, dataset, hyperparameters
Training Job Monitor Page	Real-time status, loss curve graph (using ngx-charts / Chart.js)
Evaluation Page	Form to run evaluation (BLEU, ROUGE, Perplexity)
Custom Inference Playground	Let user test their fine-tuned model

✅ Angular API Services:
DatasetService.ts

ModelService.ts

TrainingService.ts

EvaluationService.ts

ExportService.ts

✅ Folder Structure Impact (Server-Side):
bash
Copy

✅ Optional Advanced Features for Later:
Support QLoRA for small GPUs

Provide visual metrics after training (TensorBoard style)

Let users save hyperparameter presets

Allow distributed training (multi-GPU)

✅ Immediate Next Steps I Can Generate for You:
Custom Training Job API endpoint sample code

Angular training form component with field bindings

Python training job trigger (calling train.py with args)

Custom dataset upload backend and frontend

Database table design for jobs, datasets, models
